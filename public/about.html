<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student who is going to be joining engineering college soon and in the meantime I am taking a course on web development</p>
My goal for the next few years is to focus on web development,DSA and other computer programming concepts<br>
In addition to that I would also look to add certificates to my resume and do internships while also building a network with other like minded people<br>
Thank you!
